**LuCI Mobile** is a modern Flutter app for managing and monitoring multiple OpenWrt/LuCI routers. It features a beautiful Material 3 UI, secure authentication, real-time stats, and seamless multi-router support.

---

## Features

- **Multiple Router Management:** Add, switch, and manage any number of OpenWrt routers. Each router’s data is kept separate and secure.
- **Secure Login:** HTTP/HTTPS support, self-signed certificate handling, and secure credential storage.
- **Dashboard Overview:** Real-time system stats, interface status, connected clients, and interactive charts.
- **Network Interface Management:** View and monitor all wired and wireless interfaces, bandwidth, IPs, and DNS.
- **Client Management:** See all connected devices, connection type, MAC/IP, vendor, DHCP lease, and more.
- **System Control:** Remote reboot, settings, and theme customization (light/dark mode).
- **Modern UI/UX:** Material Design 3, responsive layout, and intuitive navigation.
- **Open Source:** GPLv3 licensed and available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cogwheel.LuCIMobile) and [IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/com.cogwheel.LuCIMobile).

## Multiple Router Functionality

- **Add Unlimited Routers:** Each with its own credentials and settings.
- **Quick Switch:** Instantly switch routers from the dashboard dropdown or "Manage Routers" screen.
- **Isolated Data:** Each router’s dashboard, clients, and settings are kept separate.
- **Edit & Remove:** Update credentials, rename, or remove routers at any time.
- **Auto-Connect:** Remembers your last selected router and auto-connects on launch.
- **Secure Storage:** All credentials are stored securely on your device.

## Latest OpenWrt Monitoring (v1.2.0)

- **System Status** (`More` → System Status): device, model, firmware & kernel version, uptime, load average, live memory usage, plus quick actions to restart a service or reload wireless config.
- **System Log** (`More` → System Log): reads the router's kernel/system log via `ubus call log read`.
- **WiFi** (`More` → WiFi): live per-client signal strength (RSSI/dBm) and link rate, plus an in-app channel scanner of nearby networks (`luci-rpc getWifiScan` / `getWirelessStations`).
- Android builds now target **arm64-v8a only** (see `android/app/build.gradle.kts`) to keep the APK small.

Requires `luci-mod-rpc rpcd-mod-luci rpcd-mod-iwinfo luci-mod-status` on the router, as described under Troubleshooting.

## Security & Privacy
- All credentials are stored securely on-device
- HTTPS and self-signed certificate support
- No analytics or tracking

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Failed:** Check router IP, LuCI web interface, firewall, and try both HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Authentication Failed:** Verify credentials and admin privileges.
- **No Data Displayed:** Ensure the router has LuCI RPC support: `opkg update && opkg install luci-mod-rpc rpcd-mod-luci rpcd-mod-iwinfo luci-mod-status`, restart `rpcd` (or reboot), then verify with `ubus list luci-rpc` and `ubus call luci-rpc getNetworkDevices '{}'`.
